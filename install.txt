Put main installation instructions here. i.e. Pinax installation. and any configuration changes 


Copy libs.txt and external_apps.txt from "hubplus" to src/pinax/requirements.

Make sure you have the absolute newest version of django-haystack from git repository (as of Oct 5th 2009 ). Delete the existing one from src/django-haystack and then do:

pip install --requirement requirements/external_apps.txt


HubPlus' fulltext search uses Django-Haystack so in theory you could use lots of different backends but we have chosen to go with the Solr backend since it seems to be the most supported. To install a Solr server on Linux do the following in pinax-env/src:


curl -O http://apache.mirrors.tds.net/lucene/solr/1.3.0/apache-solr-1.3.0.tgz
tar xvzf apache-solr-1.3.0.tgz
cd apache-solr-1.3.0
cd example
java -jar start.jar


** We should make the hubplus start script automatically start this service if it isn't running. **


When installing or revising your schema / search indexes
--------------------------------------------------------

python manage.py build_solr_schema

1. Take the output from that command and place it in apache-solr-1.3.0/example/solr/conf/schema.xml. 
2. Change the line: <schema name="default" version="1.1"> to <schema name="example" version="1.1"> Or to the name of the directory you actually run the start.jar from.
3. Then restart Solr.


To reindex your data
--------------------

python manage.py reindex
