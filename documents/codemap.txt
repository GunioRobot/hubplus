Hub+ Codemap

In general Hub+ uses standard django apps. We started with a number of pinax apps some of which have been overriden and modified in our apps. Hub+ diverges from standard django/pinax in a couple of respects:

1. User object has been monkey-patched (we don't change the code) to add various attributes, change password encryption algorithm, and change the name of the table that is used, for compatability with HubSpace (our space booking app which shares the database).  We also patch the relationship with groups to relate our new users to a new group structure in a way which facilitates our permissions system.

2. We have created our own permissions system, which is much more powerful than the stock django permissions. This is the major difference in how you need to code Hub+ apps which are permission aware as compared with standard django.
i)   All classes (content_types) which are permissioned are patched at start up to become "permissionable", including:
     a) being assigned a GenericReference (a persistent unique identifier of any object through a sql table indirection). 
     b) adding various methods for permissions management
     c) modifying the manager to support permissioned fetching of objects
     see: apps/plus_permissions/permissionable.py:security_patch

ii)  Functions or methods which pick up a permissioned object from the database, should return objects which are wrapped in a particular way such that only attributes and methods which the user is allowed to use can be accessed. The idea is this should reduce the risk of programmers accidentally giving access to certain data. either:
     a) use a special get method 'plus_get' on the object manager e.g. WikiPage.objects.plus_get(user=request.user, id=1)
     b) use a decorator for view functions which accept object_ids - see plus_permissions/decorators.py
     c) explicitly wrap an object using secure_wrap().
     The efficiency of wrapping in any of the above functions can be dramatically improved by restricting the required interfaces.

iii) When rendering to templates to avoid attribute errors on forbidden attribute you can optionally use the TemplateSecureWrapper which will return NotViewable, which is an object which evaluates to False in boolean context and empty string when rendered.

The Permissions Model
---------------------
Permissions are a three-way mapping between Agent (User or a Group who has rights), a permissioned object (e.g. document, page, group), and an interface to the permissioned object (e.g. 'View', 'Edit', 'Change Permissions' etc). 

In practice, we define a number of SecurityContexts each of which may correspond to an object or a set of objects e.g. a page, or all pages in a particular group. 

Access to objects in the SecurityContext is then mediated by the SecurityTag model. A SecurityTag is a mapping between a SecurityContext, an Interface and a set of Agents. Each agent in the set can access the attributes and methods of each object in the SecurityContext that are specified in the Interface definition.  

A user can access an interface via their membership of groups. Users acquire permissions from the Agents (groups) they are members of, and group recursively acquire permissions from groups they are members of.

Redis Caching
-------------
In order to evaluate permissions, we need to know which 'Agents' a particular user has. e.g. what groups they are a member of. Because groups can be members of groups, this calculation is recursive and potentially computationally intensive. We therefore use redis to cache the agents (groups) which any particular user can access object through. 


UserInterface to the Permission Model
-------------------------------------
Permissions are allocated in the UI using a simplified model which places further constraints on the underlying Permissions model. Most objects use the SecurityContext of the group they are created inside however its possible to override these Permissions on a per object basis. Although it is not possible to group objects other ways in the UI, the underlying model allows arbitrary grouping of objects under SecurityContexts.

For a specific SecurityContext the UI presents a set of object_types which may exist within it. e.g. in a group we can set permissions on Pages, Uploads, Comments etc. For each type we have a set of sliders with each slider representing a SecurityTag. If the slider is set "low" access is highly restricted, as the slider is moved upwards more agents are added to the SecurityTag. In order to fit into this model the agents at each level must be increasing in access level - it isn't possible to give a specific SecurityTag to agents higher in the slider without giving it to all those below it.



Permission Configuration for new content_types
----------------------------------------------
To create a new permissioned content type we must add a configuration file for the type: apps/plus_permissions/types/OurNewType.py

This file is used to add the new types to various maps (using functions), and define the interfaces that will wrap the objects.

*Configuration Functions*
- SetPossibleTypes(content_type, []): this is a list of types that can be created within this type
- SetVisibleTypes(content_type, [WikiPage]) : What sets of SecurityTags/Interfaces will be displayed in the UI list when we set permissions on an object of this type
- SetTypeLabels(content_type, 'Page') : What will the type be called when it is displayed in the UI
- add_type_to_interface_map(WikiPage, {map of interface_ids to Actual Interface objects}):
- SetSliderOptions(WikiPage, 'InterfaceOrder':[], 'InterfaceLabels':{}) order in which the interface_ids exist and a map of interface_ids to labels.

*Interface Definition*
Interfaces are defined as old style classes with class attributes which are equal to one of three Class objects which represent reading, writing or calling functions e.g.

class WikiPageEditor:
    set_name = InterfaceCallProperty
    title = InterfaceWriteProperty
    content = InterfaceWriteProperty
    license = InterfaceWriteProperty
    copyright_holder = InterfaceWriteProperty
    stub = InterfaceWriteProperty
    author = InterfaceWriteProperty
    author = InterfaceReadProperty
 
If an object is security wrapped for a particular user who has the "WikiPageEditor" interface, then they will be able to readand write the security wrapped object accordingly.



Apart from our heavily customised permissions system for the most part we are following standard django idioms and where possible using existing django/pinax apps. These are summarized below.


Important Apps (in the apps. directory)

1) about
Currently, we haven't changed the app. But the templates directory contains our own static pages.

2) account
Forked from Pinax original. 
Important functions in view.py include 
- home() which handles front page for both logged-in and non logged-in users (including getting from our own Feed app.)
- apply(), site_invite(), and proxied signup functions based on our own generic proxying structure - hmac_proxy which is part of the plus permission app. 
There are some other original account management functions left over in views.py which are not used and probably incompatible with current Hub+

3) avatar
This is the Pinax avatar app. which we've forked. Mainly we've replaced the reference to the User in the original Avatar class with a reference to a GenericReference. This allows us to attach avatars to TgGroups as well as Users. views.py remains largely the same except for the important new function "get_avatar" which actually returns the avatar image file itself as opposed to the URL. (This was written to support getting Hub+ avatars in HubSpace, and is probably where annoying avatar related errors are coming from.)

*) django403
Captures the 403 error and gives it a different page. This is where we'd *like* to add information about what specifically caused the permission error. (Useful for debugging and to give the users better information.) Unfortunately, by the time we get access to this, (in the middleware.py file), our PlusPermissionNoAccessException and the information it contains, seems to have been thrown away.

*) django_evolution  (copy of evolution, an app. which helps you evolve the db-schema when the ORM schema evolves, not changed) - this should probably be an external app.

*) friends_app       
Not used


*) messages       
Forked from Pinax original. The inter-user messaging app.

The main changes here are to do with putting the functions within a single tabbed page as UI. The data-model for messages is unchanged, but we now have new urls which call a view in_out_trash_comp(), a single view function which replaces the earlier in / out / trash and compose views.

*) microblogging  
This is the original Pinax microblogging app. which we've forked. I was in the process of moving from this to the new "plus_feed" app. but there's still some parts of this in use. Ideally, all important feed-related code should be migrated to plus_feed and microblogging should be decommissioned.

Important in models.py : 
We no longer use TweetInstance or Tweet for individual messages, but we do still use the Following class (and the FollowingManager) to represent and manipulat who's following who. 

In terms of views.py / urls.py we still use the views for managing follower relationships (mainly toggle_follow and toggle_group) AND for posting a new tweet (via. new ajax UI)

forms.py has been modified to use the new FeedItem model from the plus_feed app.


*) plus_feed
New app. for FeedItems. models.py defines the new FeedItem class and the FeedManager. views.py is for new views of feeds, including RSS output. But, adding feed-items is still in microblogging.

*) plus_flakes (never started, should be removed if found)

*) plus_comments 
Intended as a custom wrapper around the default django threaded-comments app. This is where we'd be able to modify the comments to fit them into our permissioning / notification feed framework. However, comments are still *currently* relying on the standard Django threaded_comments app. (Which is in site-packages)

*) plus_permissions  
An all new app. to support our permissioning framework. Includes models, views. Importantly, decorators for wrapping other views to ensure that they permission-protect objects that they work with. All the permission testing code lives in this app including "has_access" (in models).

*) plus_wiki
Our new app. that defines a WikiPage. Note that our WikiPages are subclasses of a class called "ResourceCommon" defined in the plus_groups app. resources_common.py which has the common code for handling anything that lives "inside" a TgGroup.

*) synced
The app. for making syncer connections with HubSpace. Syncer calls *into* Hub+ via http (handlers in views.py). Hub+ talks out to syncer through the functions in sync_tools.py. models.py is used just to keep a single dictionary of the connection id in the database (only place we can guarantee it's seen everywhere in django). __init__.py sets up the single-sign on. 

*) plus_contacts
A new app. designed for managing lists of Applications and Contacts. In Hub+ every new application or invite creates a Contact. If the Contact goes through the right process of accepting an invitation or having an appllication accepted, a User is created. models.py defines Applications and Contacts (+ the logic of changing status)

*) plus_groups  
Our main app. that wraps a TgGroup model table (originally from HubSpace) and uses it as the main organizing principle for people and content within Hub+.

A couple of notes : 
- Hubs are just a particular kind of TgGroup
- models.py also handles group membership, views.py handles group joing / leaving
- views.py also has various functions for setting up searches within groups
- views.py has functions for adding resources to groups such as wiki-pages, uploaded files
- resources_common.py has common code for these resources
- models.py defines Location, which in HubSpace is more like the UID of a particular Hub. plus_groups has code to manage this.
- plus_groups has code to create groups including creating Hubs
- get_enclosures and get_enclosure_ids are functions to help find member of groups that use the redis cache for speed
- MemberInvite is for invitations to groups.


*) plus_resources
This is a new app. Slightly confusingly named. "Resource" is a model representing uploaded files. Files are always uploaded within a group. 

Resources are a subclass of ResourceCommon (from plus_groups)
 

*) profiles
The original Pinax Profile class has been changed significantly. One of the main changes is that we share data between Hub+ and HubSpace in the same database. And HubSpace stores information in its user class (tg_user table)

Therefore, we've changed Profile so that many fields are now proxies to equivalent fields that we've hacked into Django's User class (see plus_user). Code for this is in models.py.

The profiles app. also defines HostQuestions, survey questions that were requested by hosts and psychosocial. Ideally, these should be moved to individual generic questions so that hosts can define their own polls. 


*) photos (not used)

*) plus_explore

New app. for searching and full text search in Hub+.

- Defines an Explorable mixin for things you want to explore.
- The important work is done by plus_search inside views.py. This is the main search routine in Hub+


*) plus_lib
A new library of generic helpers, not tied to any particular app. or area of the data-model, although some essential work goes on here that, perhaps should be moved elsewhere.

Important features :
- views.py / urls.py contains the generic "attribute editor" functions (that allow attributes of any permissionable model class to be edited)
- utils.py provides an HTMLField for forms, and some extra functions to fiddle around with details like hub names within the installation.
- users.py is not used
- search.py breaks out a couple of helper functions for constructing searches
- redis_lib.py - most of the routines for using the redis cache
- parse_json.py - a helpful json decorator
- lighttpd_serve.py - code for serving files via. lighttpd. This is derived from Django's own static file serving code and behaves similarly, but ultimately delivers the file by sending x-send-file to lightty instead of outputting the file itself.
- htmldiff.py - a copy of Ian Bicking's library for comparing files
- fixes.py - some fixes for (possibly) broken data ...
- context_processors.py - this sets up some important names in the main Django "context" that the installation uses


*) plus_tags
*) remote_syncing
*) planet
*) plus_links
*) plus_user
*) resources_search
