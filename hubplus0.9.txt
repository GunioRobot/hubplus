Tags *Tom*
      - Tag is a permissionable type - separate tag object from instances of objects tagged? tag(type, value) <-- tag_context(tag, tagged_for) <-- tag_item(tagged_by, generic_reference)
      - Tags get created in an agent - the tagged_for agent - need create_Tag for that agent
      - tags have a view interface which can be set by the tagger on any tag
      - tags have no delete method, they delete themselve when they no long exist
      - you should only see the add tag form if you have permission on the tagger_for user. Same for delete.

Phil - application process - emails send out, 
     - create group form
     - host info security setup
     - separate Hubs from groups by Location/Subclassing
