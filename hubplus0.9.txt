Tuesday-Wednesday
-----------------
- Tom Group model - group extra + tg_groups to plus_groups

- Phil + Tom - finish permissions
  * Phil implement SliderSet
  ** Define a "Contextable" behaviour for things that can be "Contexts"
  *** including some standard "create defaults" functions. Eg. if a Group can contain wiki-pages, then in a TgGroupPermissionManager, the "create_context_defaults" function will make SecurityTags for wiki-pages (ie. one for each Interface that a wiki has)
  *** Now "sliders" will simply add and remove agents from these pre-existing SecurityTags. 
  *** When a new wiki page is created and a group (say, "Hub Kings Cross") is set as its security_context, then the permission system will look at the Wiki SecurityTags for Hub Kings Cross to decide access to this wiki-page.
  *** If we then customize the settings of the wiki page, the Page becomes its own security_context, and new Wiki-page SecurityTags are created for this page.
  *** If the user then reverts this wiki to using the "defaults" from Kings Cross again, do we delete these custom SecurityTags? I think so.

  ** SliderSet to manage creation and deletion of agent-mappings. (Never creates or destroys security tags)
  ** SliderSet to represent and manage constraints
  ** SliderSet also manages creating or deleting custom security tags
  ** SliderSet to generate json for javascript sliders-set
  ** adapt json returned by javascript library to the server, it should be nothing more than a list of [ (Interface_id, Setting)
  ** SliderSet default format (create from json?)
  ** Make sure working for Profile


- Phil + Tom - sign-up, invite and apply logic
  ** create an Application class which holds things like the "request to join" message, the host's reply message
  ** similar Invite class which holds invite text 
  ** tracking the state (maybe using Tracker or directly in the Application / Invitation classes)
