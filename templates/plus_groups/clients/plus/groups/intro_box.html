	<p>Groups bring together people and resources relevant to a specific interest, project, organization or field.  They are useful for sharing and managing resources, creating online workspaces and facilitating interactions amongst members. Group administrators may choose the degree to which the content posted by members is made public or remains private.  If you are logged in, you can create a new group, join groups that already exist or simply browse.</p>
